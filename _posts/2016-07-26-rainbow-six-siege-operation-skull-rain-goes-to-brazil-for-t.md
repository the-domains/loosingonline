  The next Rainbow Six Siege expansion is called Operation Skull Rain, which is
  the sort of title I would've considered seriously bad-ass when I was 12. That
  minor quibble aside, it sounds like it could be fun: This time, following the
  chill of Black Ice and the grit of Dust Line, Ubisoft is taking its show to
  the sweltering cities of Brazil.
