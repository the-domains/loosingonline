  As promised earlier this week, Gary Busey is now live as Hitman's seventh
  Elusive Target. For the next seven days, the Hollywood legend-and so-called
  "infamous loose cannon"-will be wandering the sun-kissed streets of Sapienza
  after a falling out with advertisement organisers. "You'll never find me,"
  Busey is reported to have said following the dispute.
