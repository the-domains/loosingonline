            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>GamesBeat managing editor Jason Wilson's top 10 games of 2015</h1><p>My approach to my top 10 games of the year is ... different. I dig free-to-play online games - especially those that offer regular expansions. And I don't see why those games shouldn't be part of our look back at the year's top games.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f38e84bbfdf742f20e5886b91807b46a/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2F1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F09%2Fworldofwarships-2015-09-19-16-03-16-18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Total War: Warhammer gets pile of free DLC</h1><p>Total War: Warhammer is getting minotaurs courtesy of its Call of the Beastmen expansion, but what about all the loyal customers that don't want to shell out money for the DLC - don't they deserve some extra stuff too? No, not really, but it's nice of developer Creative Assembly to provide some anyway.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/227571e4b1303db07c4366113a6c2da7/noop.png?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net%2Fj7i3pys6ArLkwKNyygj7UQ-1200-80.png"></article>]]></description>

Now, the remake of that old game has been joined by a remake of its old expansion, The Red Odyssey.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/963f5841c622266688af45b821380d71/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net%2FJ8RR3zhJXvxX5UDGLou4WE-1200-80.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Maybe it's the fur (they just look so cuddly), or maybe it's the strange desire to wipe these monsters from the Earth, so that loved ones might resurrect, or an endless Winter might dissipate, saving mankind.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/eb373c50c733e35e811a4764a4bc96b8/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net%2Fnze47yqqBkYQTjRoEAQRs8-1200-80.jpg"></article>]]></description>
